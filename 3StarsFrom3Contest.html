        <br>
        <p>In the world of Competitive Programming (CP), earning a good star rating on CodeChef is a big deal. It is an ultimate achievement that can outshine in your resume. But the road map for this journey is not very clear to most of the students, and
            they find no easy path to start with. To become good at CP, everyone told you to choose a programming language, learn DSA, and practice a lot. I am not denying it, this all is very much important. But before beginning, you need to be aware
            of the platform where you are going to put your 3 to 4 hours a day, and that’s the real trickery behind my 3 stars from 3 contests.
            <br><br> The magic is that when we create an account on CodeChef, they already give a 1500 rating to us, which is 2 stars. But those stars are not visible on our profile until we participate in the rated contests. So, that means we all are
            2-star coder? Haha, yes, but keep one point in your mind after participating in a rated contest, you need to maintain that position (Rating on your profile) because one poor performance will decrease your rating. So, keep practicing.
            <br><br> But how did I know this? The answer is simple I took a step forward and participated in my first ever rated contest which is <a href="https://www.codechef.com/COOK129" target="_blank">MAY COOK-OFF 2021</a>, and here I attempt only
            one question out of six, and then I go to bed (it’s a 3-hour contest from 21:30 to 24:00), and what I saw in the morning, hurrah I got 2 stars with a rating 1467 by just attempting a single question, however, my rating got decreased by 37
            because I only attempted a single question.
            <br><br> You have to grind hard for improvement and don’t get depressed by seeing others’ results. Many people will suggest to you that you need to participate in various rated contests. I also agree that it’s good, but I will recommend you
            to first practise before jumping into contests.
            <br><br> To know more about <a href="https://www.codechef.com/monthly-programming-contests" target="_blank">CodeChef monthly rated contests</a>, please visit the official website of CodeChef.
            <br><br> Finally, I want to say that you all can achieve this, but you need to take that first step. Practice regularly.
            <br> I hope this article helps you, and now you are ready to start your journey.
            <br><br> All the best.
